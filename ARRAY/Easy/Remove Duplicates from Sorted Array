Hint
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements o


--------------------------my thoughts--------------------------------------

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]

I will use two pointer one at first second in 2nd element => in loop i;

0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4
k i

itrate the array only once -> chacek that ki nums[i] != nums[k] in that moment we have to swap after swapping increment k

at last return k+1 => beacuse the compiler check for(int i=0;i<k;i++) --- if the last position of the k is 4 then i have to return 5

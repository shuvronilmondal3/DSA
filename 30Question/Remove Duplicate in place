think of a data structure which store only distinct value
yes.. you guess it right , that is set 

just traverse over the array and put all the array element in the set 
return set size 
## but but you also have to to pay attention that in question said that they need in place 

just set se value uthao and first k element tak array me bhar do

set<int> s;
for(auto i :nums){
  s.insert(i);
}
int k = s.size();
int j =0;
for(auto i : s){
  nums[j++] = i;
}
return k;
